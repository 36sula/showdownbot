# Showdown
Showdown is a Pokémon battle-bot that can play battles on [Pokemon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/).

The bot can play games in generations 4 through 7 however some of the evaluation logic is assuming gen7 mechanics.

## Getting Started

### Python version
Developed and testing using Python 3.6.3.

### Installing
Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Be sure to use a virtual environment to isolate your packages.

### Tests
Run all tests with `python -m unittest discover -s tests/ -t .`

### Configuration
Showdown uses environment variables for configuration, which are read from a file named `.env` in the root of the project.

The configurations available are:
```
SAVE_REPLAY: (bool, default False) Specifies whether or not to save replays of the battles
LOG_TO_FILE: (bool, default False) Specifies whether or not to save for each battle to a file in {PWD}/logs/
LOG_LEVEL: (string, default "DEBUG") The Python logging level 
WEBSOCKET_URI: (string, default is the official PokemonShowdown websocket address: "sim.smogon.com:8000") The address to use to connect to the Pokemon Showdown websocket 
PS_USERNAME: (string, required) Pokemon Showdown username
PS_PASSWORD: (string, required) Pokemon Showdown password
BOT_MODE: (string, required) The mode the the bot will operate in. Options are "CHALLENGE_USER", "SEARCH_LADDER", or "ACCEPT_CHALLENGE"
USER_TO_CHALLENGE: (string, required if BOT_MODE is "CHALLENGE_USER") The user to challenge
POKEMON_MODE: (string, required) The type of game this bot will play games in
TEAM_NAME: (string, required if POKEMON_MODE is one where a team is required): The name of the JSON file that contains the team you want to use. More on this below in the Specifying Teams section.
RUN_COUNT: (integer, required) The amount of games this bot will play before quitting
```

Here is a sample `.env` file:
```
SAVE_REPLAY=False
LOG_TO_FILE=False
LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"
WEBSOCKET_URI="localhost:8000"
PS_USERNAME="MyCoolUsername"
PS_PASSWORD="MySuperSecretPassword"
BOT_MODE="CHALLENGE_USER"
USER_TO_CHALLENGE="SomeScrub"
POKEMON_MODE="gen7randombattle"
TEAM_NAME="ou_sample"
RUN_COUNT=1
```


### Running
Running with `python run.py` will start the bot with the settings specified in your `.env` file.


## Decision Logic

Showdown decides which move to make by first simulating all possible transpositions for 2 turns.
An evaluation function is used to score each combination of moves and a decision is made about which the best move(s) are.

Most aspects of Pokémon are accounted for, such as:

1. Damage Rolls

2. Spreads

3. Move-Sets

4. Abilities

5. Items

6. Hazards

7. Weather

## Specifying Teams
The user can specify teams in JSON format to be used for non-random battles. Examples can be found in `teams/team_jsons/`.

The name of the `.json` file must used as `TEAM_NAME` in the configuration file.
